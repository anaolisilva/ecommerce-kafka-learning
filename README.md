## Kafka Learning 👩‍💻🗣

This is a project I developed to learn basic concepts and the working of Apache Kafka. 
It mocks an e-commerce, but the real purpose was to help me grasp how Kafka works as a broker.
The services are not implemented, they just produce and consume messages.
Since I couldn't separate the services in new modules because of a problem with Maven/Kotlin, I've simply separated them into different packages.
